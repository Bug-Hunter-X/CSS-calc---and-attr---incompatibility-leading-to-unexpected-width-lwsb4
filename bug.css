The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to the use of the `calc()` function and the `attr()` function together within a CSS variable:

```css
:root {
  --element-width: calc(attr(data-width) * 1px);
}

.element {
  width: var(--element-width);
}
```

The issue stems from trying to directly multiply the value obtained from `attr(data-width)` by `1px` within the `calc()` function.  `attr()` returns a string, and CSS's `calc()` function has limited support for string manipulation and unit conversions in this context. While `calc()` can handle mathematical operations, it typically expects numeric values with units.
